Most importantly, these include the use of network-specific coins or tokens to incentivize work and assign access or voting rights, and a standardized process for suggesting changes to the system (usually following the example of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, itself inspired by BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals).</span></li>\\n<li><span style=\\\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \\\"Segoe UI\\\", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \\\"Fira Sans\\\", \\\"Droid Sans\\\", \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", sans-serif;\\\">Founding documents describing the core features of a given DAO often include an (explicit or implicit) ideological position on the relative merits of formal vs. informal and ’on-chain’ vs. ’off-chain’ governance. [5] Based on that initial position, many DAOs have modeled themselves – consciously or not – either after Bitcoin and Ethereum (limited on-chain governance combined with semi-formalized off-chain governance) or the early pioneers in token-based voting and treasury management (e.g. Decred and Tezos; more expansive on-chain governance).</span></li>\\n<li><span style=\\\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \\\"Segoe UI\\\", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \\\"Fira Sans\\\", \\\"Droid Sans\\\", \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", sans-serif;\\\">Faced with high technological uncertainty and not much experience to go by, DAOs often integrate battle-tested code, operational procedures, and tools for governance that other DAOs are using. Compared to traditional organizations, this is much easier for DAOs because many blockchain projects are committed to open sourcing their software which is also highly composable if created for the same platform, as is the case with decentralized financial (DeFi) and governance applications on Ethereum. Examples include broad adoption of the Gnosis multisig wallet, Compound’s governance contract, and the Snapshot tool for off-chain voting. In other ecosystems that enable interoperability between different networks and DAOs, some mimetic isomorphism will inevitably result from the use of common development frameworks such as the Cosmos SDK and Substrate.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 20px;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \\\"Segoe UI\\\", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \\\"Fira Sans\\\", \\\"Droid Sans\\\", \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", sans-serif;\\\">Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect.
